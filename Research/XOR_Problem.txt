Minsky and Papert (1969)
 The XOR Problem

 Through use of very basic 1 layer neurons (perceptron) AND and OR are easy to represent.
   (See reference: /References/XOR_Problem.txt)

But XOR is impossible to represent in this similar fashion.

The weight equations for AND and OR are linear. Their inputs can be seperated into two 
categories by a linear divide.

However XOR cannot be seperated in this manner. Therefore it is linearly separable function.


Goodfellow et al. found a solution using two nodes (hidden layer)
 - This multi layer network allowed the two input [1,0] [0,1] to be collapsed into one node and 
    thus became linearly separable
