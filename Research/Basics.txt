What is it?
 - a modern neural network is a network of small computing units, each
   of which takes a vector of input values and produces a single output value.

When to use?
 - Nets that are very deep are particularly good at representation learning. For that reason
   deep neural nets are the right tool for tasks that offer sufficient data to learn features
   automatically.

Heart of Neural Networks: 
  - neural unit = bias + sumOf(weight * input)
      (a = b + ∑wx)

weight and input are often represented as vectors, so w·x

With these functions, it is possible to represent a large range of values
 Therefore it must be limited. 

 - sigmoid: (0 to 1 is most convenient)
     y = σ(w·x + b) = 1 / 1+exp(−(w·x + b))
 - tanh: in almost every case, tanh is better
     (-1 to 1): y = tanh(z) = e^z - e^-z / e^z + e^-z
 - rectified linear unit or ReLU: most common and most simple
     (0 to +∞): y = max(z,0)


Potential Issues:
  - Vanishing gradient: sigmoid and tanh

  - ReLU: not diff. for all values
